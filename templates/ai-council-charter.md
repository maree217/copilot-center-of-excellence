## 4. Key Principles for Success
1.  **Don't Be the "Department of No":** The goal is to enable safe innovation, not to block it.
2.  **Agility:** AI moves fast. Policies must be living documents, not set in stone.
3.  **Transparency:** Communicate the Council's decisions openly to the workforce to build trust.
