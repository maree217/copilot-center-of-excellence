## 📊 Quick ROI Estimation

While the full calculator is being built, use this simplified framework:

### Step 1: Estimate Time Savings
```
Hours saved per week per user = [Your estimate, typically 5-10 hours]
Number of users = [Your user count]
Average hourly cost = [Salary + benefits / 2,080 hours]

Annual time savings value = Hours/week × 52 weeks × Users × Hourly cost
```

### Step 2: Calculate Costs
```
Annual licensing = Users × $30 × 12 months = $____
Implementation cost = [One-time: typically $50K-$500K depending on scale]
Annual support = [Ongoing: typically 10-15% of implementation]

Total 3-year cost = (Annual licensing × 3) + Implementation + (Annual support × 3)
```

### Step 3: Calculate ROI
```
3-year benefit = Annual time savings × 3
3-year cost = Total calculated above

ROI = [(3-year benefit - 3-year cost) / 3-year cost] × 100%
Payback period = 3-year cost / Annual time savings value
```

## 📈 Benchmarks from Real Implementations

Based on our case studies and industry data:

### Conservative Scenario
- **Time savings:** 4-6 hours/user/week
- **ROI:** 200-300% over 3 years
- **Payback period:** 12-18 months

### Moderate Scenario (Most Common)
- **Time savings:** 6-10 hours/user/week
- **ROI:** 350-500% over 3 years
- **Payback period:** 9-12 months

### Optimistic Scenario
- **Time savings:** 10-15 hours/user/week
- **ROI:** 500-800% over 3 years
- **Payback period:** 6-9 months

**Real example from our Financial Services case study:**
- 5,000 users
- 8.5 hours saved per user per week
- $12M annual productivity gain
- $2.8M implementation cost
- **ROI: 428% over 3 years**
- **Payback: 8 months**
