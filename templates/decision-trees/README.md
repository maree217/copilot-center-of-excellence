## 💡 Decision Principles

### 1. Start Simple
- Always try the simplest solution first
- You can always add complexity later
- Validate assumptions before committing

### 2. Measure Real ROI
- Pilot before full deployment
- Track actual time savings
- Calculate total cost of ownership
- Ensure 3x+ ROI for custom builds

### 3. Consider Long-Term
- Factor in maintenance costs
- Account for team turnover
- Plan for scaling needs
- Strategic importance (3-5 year view)

### 4. Be Honest About Capabilities
- Do you have the right team?
- Can you maintain custom code?
- What's your risk tolerance?
- Is this truly differentiating?
