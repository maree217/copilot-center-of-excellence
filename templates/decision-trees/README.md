## 🚧 Coming Soon

Decision tree templates are under development. Check back soon for:

### 1. Build vs Buy Decision Matrix
**Helps answer:** Should we build custom agents or use out-of-the-box solutions?

**Factors considered:**
- Complexity of requirements
- Time to value
- Available technical resources
- Budget constraints
- Maintenance capabilities
- Strategic importance

---

### 2. Agent Type Selection Framework
**Helps answer:** Should I use declarative agents, custom engine agents, or Azure AI Foundry?

**Decision points:**
- Use case complexity
- Required customization level
- Development team capabilities
- Integration requirements
- Scalability needs
- Budget and licensing

---

### 3. Deployment Model Decision Tree
**Helps answer:** Which deployment approach is right for my organization?

**Options evaluated:**
- Pilot-first (recommended)
- Wave-based rollout
- Big bang deployment
- Phased by department
- Phased by use case

**Factors:**
- Organization size
- Risk tolerance
- Change management maturity
- Executive sponsorship strength

### 4. Data Integration Pattern Selection
**Helps answer:** How should I connect Copilot to my data sources?

**Patterns:**
- Direct connectors (Power Platform)
- Custom APIs
- Microsoft Graph
- Azure Data Services
- Hybrid approaches

**Considerations:**
- Data volume and velocity
- Real-time requirements
- Security and compliance
- Existing infrastructure
- Cost optimization
