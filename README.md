# Enterprise AI & Copilot Implementation

> Frameworks, architectures, and battle-tested approaches from 100+ enterprise AI deployments

---

## About This Repository

This is the methodology behind successful enterprise AI transformations. While AI tools can generate frameworks and templates, **delivering real transformation requires human expertise** - navigating organizational politics, making judgment calls in ambiguous situations, and being accountable for outcomes.

This repository demonstrates the depth of that expertise.

**What's here:**
- Proven implementation frameworks used in regulated industries
- Security architectures that passed SEC, FINRA, and HIPAA audits
- Real case studies with documented ROI ($12M+ annual returns)
- Templates and tools you can use immediately

## Core Frameworks

### The 4-Pillar Implementation Framework
The foundation for enterprise AI success:

```
Getting Ready → Onboarding & Engaging → Delivering Impact → Extending & Optimizing
```

> "90% of AI success is human behavior. Only 10% is technology."

[Learn the framework →](./docs/leadership-course/01-implementation-framework.md)

### MOCA & Scenario Engineering
7-step methodology for identifying and validating high-value AI use cases before deployment.

## Work With Me

I help enterprises deploy AI that actually gets adopted and delivers measurable results.

### Engagement Models

**Embedded AI Leadership**
Join your team as a fractional AI lead - attending executive meetings, making decisions, navigating stakeholders, and being accountable for outcomes.

**Implementation Delivery**
Hands-on deployment: architecture, configuration, security, rollout, training, and support through adoption.

**Strategic Workshops**
Facilitated sessions to align leadership, prioritize scenarios, establish governance, or assess readiness.

**Advisory & Support**
Ongoing guidance, architecture reviews, and access to my network when you need expert input.

### How I Typically Work

Most engagements come through specialist recruiters and follow traditional contracting models. I'm flexible on structure - day rate, fixed price, or outcome-based - depending on what works for your organization.

**What I bring that AI tools cannot:**
- Accountability for outcomes
- Judgment in ambiguous situations
- Navigation of organizational politics
- Relationships and network access
- Physical presence when it matters
