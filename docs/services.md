# Working Together

Expert delivery for enterprise AI and Microsoft Copilot implementations.

---

## What I Do

I help enterprises deploy AI that gets adopted and delivers measurable outcomes. This typically means:

- **Leading AI programs** as an embedded expert or fractional AI lead
- **Designing and building** Copilot solutions, custom agents, and integrations
- **Navigating complexity** - security, compliance, organizational politics, change management
- **Facilitating decisions** - getting executives aligned and scenarios prioritized
- **Ensuring adoption** - because technology that doesn't get used delivers zero ROI

## Engagement Models

I'm flexible on how we work together. Here are the common patterns:

### Embedded / Contract Role
Join your team as a senior AI specialist, architect, or delivery lead. Day rate or monthly, typically through your preferred agency or directly.

**What this looks like:**
- Part of your team (2-5 days/week)
- Attend your meetings, work with your people
- Accountable for delivery outcomes
- Duration: typically 3-12 months

**Best for:** Organisations building AI capability who need experienced hands

---

### Project-Based Delivery
Fixed scope, defined deliverables, agreed timeline.

**Examples:**
- Architecture design and documentation
- Security assessment and remediation
- Pilot deployment for initial use cases
- Production rollout across waves
- Custom agent development

**Best for:** Specific outcomes with clear boundaries

---

### Workshops & Facilitation
Facilitated sessions to drive alignment and decisions.

**Examples:**
- AI strategy alignment (leadership team)
- Scenario prioritisation sprint
- AI Council/governance launch
- Architecture decision session
- Readiness assessment

**Best for:** When you need humans in a room making real decisions

---

### Advisory Retainer
Ongoing access for guidance, reviews, and problem-solving.

**What this looks like:**
- Regular check-ins (weekly/fortnightly)
- Architecture and code reviews
- Escalation support
- Access to my network when needed

**Best for:** Organisations with internal teams who need expert backup

## How Engagements Typically Start

**Most of my work comes through specialist recruiters** who reach out on behalf of clients looking for AI/Copilot expertise. If you're working with an agency, feel free to share this repository as evidence of capability.

**For direct enquiries**, I'm happy to have a conversation about your needs and whether I can help. No obligation, no sales pitch.
