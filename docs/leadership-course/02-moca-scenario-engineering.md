# MOCA & Scenario Engineering: The Blueprint for Value

## Executive Summary
The **Modern Collaboration Architecture (MOCA)** is a framework designed to centre digital transformation around people and their workflows, rather than the technology itself. It operates on the fundamental truth: **"People don't adopt technology; they adopt behaviours associated with the use of a particular technology."**

This document outlines the **7-Step Scenario Framework**, a rigorous engineering process for defining high-value AI use cases that drive measurable business impact.

## The MOCA Philosophy
*   **People-Centric:** Technology is merely an enabler. The focus must be on the human element—the "Who" and the "How."
*   **Attention Harnessing:** In an era of digital overload, successful scenarios must harness attention rather than fragment it.
*   **Behavioural Change:** Success is defined by stopping old, inefficient habits and starting new, AI-empowered ones.

## The 7-Step Scenario Framework

### Step 1: Target Audience (The "Who")
*   **Definition:** Clearly identify the specific role or persona who will execute this scenario.
*   **Granularity:** Avoid generic terms like "Employees." Be specific: "Field Sales Representative," "Senior Project Manager," "HR Benefits Specialist."
*   **Context:** Understand their daily pressures and KPIs.

### Step 2: Focus Area (The MOCA Context)
*   **MOCA on a Page:** Utilise the "MOCA on a Page" artifact to map the scenario to a specific collaboration need.
*   **Categories:** Is this about *Individual Productivity*, *Teamwork*, *Community Engagement*, or *Organisational Alignment*?
*   **Current State:** Briefly document how the task is performed today (without Copilot).

### Step 3: Business Challenge & Opportunity
*   **The Pain Point:** What is the friction? (e.g., "Sales reps spend 4 hours a week summarising client calls.")
*   **The Opportunity:** What is the vision? (e.g., "Instant call summaries allow reps to focus on relationship building.")
*   **Generative AI Role:** How specifically does GenAI solve this? (Summarisation, Content Creation, Data Synthesis).

### Step 4: Behaviours (Start/Stop)
*   **The Core Shift:** Define the explicit behavioural changes required.
    *   **STOP:** Manually taking notes during meetings; searching through nested folders for policy documents.
    *   **START:** Using Copilot to transcribe and summarise; using natural language to query the knowledge base.
*   **Attention Harnessing:** Ensure the new behaviour keeps the user in their "flow of work" rather than context switching.

### Step 5: Prompt Engineering (The 5 Components)
A prompt is not just a question; it is a programmed instruction. A "Gold Standard" prompt must contain:
1.  **Persona:** Who should Copilot act as? (e.g., "You are an expert copywriter.")
2.  **Audience:** Who is this for? (e.g., "For a technical executive audience.")
3.  **Context:** What is the background? (e.g., "Using the attached project specs...")
4.  **Objective:** What is the specific task? (e.g., "Draft a risk assessment email.")
5.  **Output:** How should it look? (e.g., "Format as a bulleted list with a professional tone.")

### Step 6: Benefits (Value Realisation)
*   **Quantifiable Metrics:**
    *   **Time:** Hours saved per week.
    *   **Cost:** Reduction in agency spend or operational costs.
*   **Qualitative Metrics:**
    *   **Quality:** Improved accuracy or consistency.
    *   **Employee Experience:** Reduction in burnout/drudgery.

### Step 7: Strategic Priorities
*   **Alignment:** How does this scenario support the organisation's "Big Rocks" or strategic goals for the year?
*   **Force Multiplier:** Does this unlock further opportunities (e.g., faster time-to-market)?

## The Prioritisation Matrix
Not all scenarios are created equal. Use this matrix to rank them for implementation.

### Priority 1: "Quick Wins" & High Impact
*   **Characteristics:** Low complexity, high frequency, immediate value.
*   **Examples:** Meeting summarisation, email drafting, document synthesis.
*   **Action:** Implement immediately to build momentum.

### Priority 2: Strategic Value
*   **Characteristics:** Higher complexity, requires specific data grounding, high business value.
*   **Examples:** RFP response generation, automated monthly reporting.
*   **Action:** Plan for the second wave of rollout.

### Priority 3: Niche & Complex
*   **Characteristics:** Very specific to a small group, high technical dependency.
*   **Examples:** Custom code generation for legacy systems.
*   **Action:** Backlog for the "Extending & Optimising" phase.
