# Governance & Enablement: The Control System

## Executive Summary
To scale Microsoft Copilot effectively, organisations must balance **empowerment** with **control**. This document outlines the governance structures and enablement resources required to build a robust "Copilot Control System."

## 1. The AI Council
**Objective:** To provide strategic oversight and ethical governance without stifling innovation.

### Composition
A balanced AI Council should not be dominated solely by IT. It must include:
*   **Executive Leadership (C-Suite):** To align AI strategy with business goals.
*   **Security & Compliance (CISO/Risk):** To ensure data protection and Zero Trust adherence.
*   **Human Resources (CHRO):** To manage the "people" aspect—skills, job evolution, and anxiety.
*   **Business Unit Leaders:** To represent the practical needs of the workforce.

### Core Responsibilities
*   **Responsible AI Standard:** Defining the organisation's ethical boundaries (e.g., "Human in the loop" policies).
*   **Data Governance:** Deciding which data sources are indexed and accessible to Copilot.
*   **Avoiding "Analysis Paralysis":** The Council must enable **action**. The goal is to start using AI to understand it, not to block it with excessive bureaucracy.

## 2. The Copilot Success Kit
**Objective:** A comprehensive toolkit provided by Microsoft to accelerate adoption.

### The User Enablement Guide
The Success Kit breaks down the rollout into two distinct categories of tasks:

#### A. Essential Tasks (New for the AI Era)
These are specific to Generative AI and require new muscles:
*   **Prompt Engineering Training:** Teaching users how to "speak AI."
*   **AI Ethics Education:** Ensuring users understand bias and verification (Always verify Copilot's output).
*   **Data Hygiene:** Cleaning up permissions (Oversharing) before rollout.

#### B. Foundational Tasks (Standard Change Management)
These are the evergreen best practices for any IT rollout:
*   **Executive Sponsorship:** Visible leadership support.
*   **Champions Network:** Peer-to-peer advocacy.
*   **Communication Plans:** Regular updates and "What's in it for me?" messaging.

### Enablement Tools
*   **SharePoint Hub:** A central "Centre of Excellence" site to house training videos, policy documents, and success stories.
*   **Viva Engage:** The community platform for Q&A and sharing prompts.
*   **Viva Learning:** Delivering the "Copilot Academy" curriculum directly in the flow of work.

## 3. The Scenario Library
**Objective:** To move from ad-hoc usage to strategic value by curating "Gold Standard" use cases.

### Building the Library
*   **Source:** Harvest scenarios from your Champions Network and early adopters.
*   **Validation:** The AI Council or a sub-committee should vet scenarios for security and value.
*   **Structure:** Each entry in the library should follow the **7-Step Scenario Framework** (see `02_MOCA_and_Scenario_Framework.md`).

### Managing the Library
*   **Living Document:** The library is never "finished." It must evolve as Copilot gains new features (e.g., Python in Excel, Copilot Agents).
*   **Prioritisation:** Use the library to track which scenarios are Priority 1 (Quick Wins) vs. Priority 2/3 (Long-term strategic).
*   **Access:** Make this library easily searchable on the SharePoint Hub so users can "copy and paste" success.
