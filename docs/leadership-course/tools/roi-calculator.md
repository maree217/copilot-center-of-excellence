|----------|--------|--------|
| Microsoft Copilot licenses | £_________ | £_________ |
| Ongoing support & maintenance | £_________ | £_________ |
| **Total Year 2** | **£_________** | |
| **Total Year 3** | | **£_________** |

**Example (2,000 employees):**
- Year 2: £592,800 (licenses) + £40,000 (support) = £632,800
- Year 3: £592,800 (licenses) + £30,000 (support) = £622,800

---

### 3-Year Total Cost of Ownership

```
Year 1 + Year 2 + Year 3 = £_________

Example: £745,300 + £632,800 + £622,800 = £2,000,900
```

**Your 3-Year TCO:** £_________

---

## Step 5: Calculate Productivity Gains

### Annual Time Savings

**Formula:**
```
Number of Employees × Adoption Rate × Time Saved per Week × 48 Working Weeks
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
_________ employees × _____% adoption × _____ hours/week × 48 weeks = _________ hours saved annually
```

**Example (2,000 employees, 75% adoption, 3 hours/week):**
```
2,000 × 0.75 × 3 × 48 = 216,000 hours saved annually
```

---

### Annual Productivity Value

**Formula:**
```
Hours Saved Annually × Average Hourly Cost = Annual Productivity Gains
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
_________ hours × £_____ /hour = £_________
```

**Example:**
```
216,000 hours × £50/hour = £10,800,000 annually
```

**Your Annual Productivity Gains:** £_________

---

### 3-Year Productivity Value

Assume productivity gains remain constant (conservative):

```
Year 1 Gains × 3 = £_________

Example: £10,800,000 × 3 = £32,400,000
```

**Your 3-Year Productivity Gains:** £_________

---

## Step 6: Calculate ROI

### Year 1 ROI

**Formula:**
```
ROI % = [(Annual Gains - Year 1 Cost) / Year 1 Cost] × 100
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
ROI = [(£_________ - £_________) / £_________] × 100 = ______ %
```

**Example:**
```
ROI = [(£10,800,000 - £745,300) / £745,300] × 100 = 1,349%
```

**Your Year 1 ROI:** ______ %

---

### 3-Year ROI

**Formula:**
```
3-Year ROI % = [(3-Year Gains - 3-Year TCO) / 3-Year TCO] × 100
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
ROI = [(£_________ - £_________) / £_________] × 100 = ______ %
```

**Example:**
```
ROI = [(£32,400,000 - £2,000,900) / £2,000,900] × 100 = 1,519%
```

**Your 3-Year ROI:** ______ %

---

### Payback Period

**How long until you break even?**

**Formula:**
```
Payback Period (months) = (Year 1 Cost / Annual Gains) × 12
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
(£_________ / £_________) × 12 = ______ months
```

**Example:**
```
(£745,300 / £10,800,000) × 12 = 0.83 months ≈ 25 days
```

**Your Payback Period:** ______ months

**Interpretation:**
- < 3 months: Exceptional
- 3-6 months: Excellent
- 6-12 months: Good
- > 12 months: Review assumptions

---

## Step 7: ROI Summary Dashboard

**Your Business Case at a Glance:**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year Total |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Costs** | £_________ | £_________ | £_________ | £_________ |
| **Productivity Gains** | £_________ | £_________ | £_________ | £_________ |
| **Net Benefit** | £_________ | £_________ | £_________ | £_________ |
| **ROI %** | _____% | _____% | _____% | _____% |

**Key Metrics:**
- ✅ **Payback Period:** ______ months
- ✅ **Net Present Value (NPV):** £_________ (3-year)
- ✅ **Time Saved per Employee:** ______ hours/week
- ✅ **Adoption Rate:** ______%

---

## Step 8: Sensitivity Analysis

**Test different scenarios to understand risk:**

### Scenario A: Conservative (Low Risk)
| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Time saved/week | 2 hours |
| Adoption rate | 60% |
| Implementation cost | £150,000 (full consulting) |

**Result:**
- Annual Gains: £_________
- Year 1 ROI: _____%
- Payback: ______ months

---

### Scenario B: Moderate (Recommended)
| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Time saved/week | 3 hours |
| Adoption rate | 75% |
| Implementation cost | £127,500 (full consulting) |

**Result:**
- Annual Gains: £_________
- Year 1 ROI: _____%
- Payback: ______ months

---

### Scenario C: Optimistic (High Adoption + Custom Agents)
| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Time saved/week | 5 hours |
| Adoption rate | 85% |
| Implementation cost | £200,000 (consulting + 4 custom agents) |

**Result:**
- Annual Gains: £_________
- Year 1 ROI: _____%
- Payback: ______ months

---

## Step 9: Qualitative Benefits (Not Quantified)

**These benefits are real but harder to measure in £:**

✅ **Employee Retention**
- Forrester: 20% reduction in attrition
- Cost of turnover: 1.5-2× annual salary
- Example: Retain 10 employees/year = £500k-£1M saved

✅ **Faster Onboarding**
- Forrester: 25% faster time-to-productivity
- Example: New hire productive in 3 months instead of 4

✅ **Employee Satisfaction**
- TAL Insurance: 30% increase in satisfaction scores
- Reduces burnout, improves morale

✅ **Quality Improvements**
- TAL Insurance: Fewer errors in claims processing
- Commercial Bank of Dubai: Consistent communication tone

✅ **Competitive Advantage**
- Faster response to market changes
- Ability to scale without headcount increases
- Attract top talent ("we use AI")

**Estimated Qualitative Value:** £500k-£2M annually (conservative)

---

## Step 10: Risk-Adjusted ROI

**Account for risks that might reduce ROI:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Low adoption** (< 50%) | 20% | -40% ROI | Champions Network, strong change mgmt |
| **Security incident** | 5% | -£500k | DLP policies BEFORE pilot |
| **Delayed rollout** | 15% | -6 months | AI Council makes fast decisions |
| **Overestimated time savings** | 25% | -20% ROI | Measure baselines before pilot |

**Risk-Adjusted ROI Formula:**
```
Adjust ROI down by 20-30% for conservative projections

Example: 1,349% ROI × 0.75 = 1,012% (risk-adjusted)
```

**Your Risk-Adjusted Year 1 ROI:** ______ %

**Even with 30% haircut, you're likely seeing 800-1,000% ROI.**
