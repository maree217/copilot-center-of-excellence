# AI Leadership Course

> **The Executive Framework for Enterprise AI Transformation**

## Overview

This course is designed for senior leaders, CIOs, CDOs, and Enterprise Architects who need to move beyond "experimenting" with AI to systematically driving business value at scale.

**Core Principle:**
> "90% of AI success is human behavior. Only 10% is technology."

This isn't a technical training—it's a strategic transformation framework grounded in Microsoft's "Gold Standard" methodologies, adapted as universal principles for any enterprise AI deployment.

**[Read Module 1 →](./01-implementation-framework.md)**

Learn the **4-Pillar Framework** that underpins every successful AI deployment:

1. **Getting Ready**: Technical + Cultural Readiness
   - Executive Sponsorship & The "Why"
   - Building Your AI Council
   - Scenario Selection Before Deployment

2. **Onboarding & Engaging**: Building Proficiency
   - Cohort-Based Rollouts
   - Champions Network Strategy
   - Managing AI Anxiety

---

### Module 2: MOCA & Scenario Engineering
**[Read Module 2 →](./02-moca-scenario-engineering.md)**

Master the **Modern Collaboration Architecture (MOCA)** and the **7-Step Scenario Framework** for engineering high-value AI use cases.

**The 7-Step Framework:**

1. **Target Audience**: Define the specific role/persona
2. **Focus Area**: Map to MOCA collaboration context
3. **Business Challenge**: Identify the pain point and opportunity
4. **Behaviors**: Define what to STOP and START doing
5. **Prompt Engineering**: The 5 components of gold-standard prompts
6. **Benefits**: Quantify time, cost, quality improvements
7. **Strategic Priorities**: Align to organizational goals

**The Prioritization Matrix:**
- Priority 1: Quick wins (immediate implementation)
- Priority 2: Strategic value (second wave)
- Priority 3: Niche/complex (backlog)

**Key Takeaway**: Don't "play" with AI—engineer scenarios with measurable business outcomes.

---

### Module 3: Governance & The Success Kit
**[Read Module 3 →](./03-governance-success-kit.md)**

Build the control structures needed to scale AI safely across the enterprise.

**The AI Council:**
- Composition: Executive, Security, HR, Business Leaders
- Mandate: Define Responsible AI standards
- Goal: Enable action, not create bureaucracy

**The Copilot Success Kit:**
- Essential Tasks (New for AI): Prompt training, AI ethics, data hygiene
- Foundational Tasks (Change Management): Sponsorship, champions, communications

**The Scenario Library:**
- Curate "Gold Standard" use cases
- Validate for security and value
- Make searchable and reusable

**Key Takeaway**: Governance is about empowerment with guardrails, not gatekeeping.

---

### Module 4: Security, Testing & Compliance
**[Read Module 4 →](./04-security-testing-compliance.md)**

Implement enterprise-grade security controls and quality assurance for production AI deployments.

**The Copilot Control System (CCS):**
- Three Pillars: Security, Management, Measurement
- Microsoft Purview Integration
- DLP Policies & Zero Trust Architecture

**Quality Gates:**
- Automated Testing Framework (Power CAT Kit)
- Pre-Deployment Validation Protocols
- Multi-Turn Scenario Testing
- CI/CD with Power Platform Pipelines

**Compliance Frameworks:**
- GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 Alignment
- Industry-Specific Requirements
- Audit Trail Management

**Key Takeaway**: Enterprise AI requires production-grade security and systematic testing—not just "hope it works."

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this specific to Microsoft Copilot?**
A: While examples use Microsoft Copilot, the frameworks apply to any enterprise AI deployment. Tools change. Principles don't.

**Q: How long does a typical implementation take?**
A: Pilot (100 users): 6-8 weeks. Enterprise-wide (1,000+ users): 4-6 months. These timelines assume proper planning.

**Q: What's the typical ROI?**
A: Most organizations see 5-10 hours saved per knowledge worker per month. At scale, this translates to 15-25% productivity gain. See [ROI Calculator](../../templates/roi-calculator.xlsx).

**Q: How do we manage resistance to AI?**
A: Module 1 covers this extensively. Key strategies: Executive sponsorship, Champions Network, focusing on "AI as talent extension" messaging, and demonstrating quick wins.

**Q: Do we need a dedicated AI team?**
A: For initial deployment, yes—typically 3-5 people full-time. Post-launch, 1-2 FTE for ongoing governance and optimization. The AI Council is part-time representation.

**Q: What about security and compliance?**
A: Module 4 provides comprehensive guidance. Start with Zero Trust architecture, DLP policies for sensitive data, and human-in-the-loop requirements for high-risk scenarios.
