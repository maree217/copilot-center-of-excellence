## ❓ Common Questions

### "Where should I start?"
Choose your role above and follow that path. Most people start with either:
- **Executives**: Getting Started for Executives
- **Technical**: Technical Implementation Module 0

### "How much time will this take?"
- **Quick Overview**: 30 minutes
- **Executive Understanding**: 2-3 hours
- **Architect Mastery**: 8-12 hours
- **Developer Mastery**: 16-20 hours

### "Is this only for Microsoft Copilot?"
While focused on Microsoft Copilot, the frameworks and methodologies apply to any enterprise AI deployment. The principles transcend specific tools.

### "Can I skip the business/strategy stuff?"
If you're technical, you might be tempted to jump straight to code. Don't. Understanding the strategic context makes you far more effective. Spend 1-2 hours on the Leadership Course first.

### "What if my industry isn't covered?"
Find the closest match in case studies, then adapt. Regulated industries are similar (Finance ≈ Healthcare ≈ Government). Operations-heavy industries are similar (Manufacturing ≈ Logistics).

### "How often is this updated?"
We actively maintain this repository. Check the [main README](../../README.md) for recent updates. Major additions monthly.
